# CS2 Multiplayer Mod

## Introduction

CS2 Multiplayer Mod brings cooperative multiplayer to Cities: Skylines II. One player hosts a city, friends join, and everyone builds the same city together.

The mod is **experimental**. Back up your saves before hosting or joining, and expect bugs while development continues. The host is authoritative, and clients download the host's world when they join.

## Requirements

- Cities: Skylines II 
- **All players must run the same version of the mod.** A mismatched build is refused at join, so update together.
- Players should also have **matching gameplay DLC**. Radio and content-only DLC do not affect a session.

## Install

The easiest way is through **Paradox Mods**: find the mod, add it to your playset, enable it, and restart the game if Cities: Skylines II asks you to.

## Hosting a game

1. Create a new city or open an existing one. If you use an existing save, **make a backup first**.
2. Open the in-game Multiplayer panel (or the mod settings).
3. Set your player name.
4. In the Host tab, choose the port, password, max players, LAN-only mode, and world re-sync interval.
5. Click **Host Session**.
6. For internet play, forward the chosen TCP port on your router, allow it through your firewall, and share the host address, port, and password **only with people you trust**.

## Joining a game

1. Click **Join Game** from the main menu, or open the Join tab in the mod settings.
2. Enter the host address, port, your player name, and the password.
3. Click **Join Session**.
4. Wait while the host's city downloads and loads — larger cities take longer. The dialog closes itself once you're in.

## Troubleshooting

- **City looks out of sync?** Run `/sync` in chat, or click **Sync World Now** in the mod settings. Clients pull a fresh save from the host; the host refreshes every connected player.
- **Can't join (protocol mismatch)?** You and the host are on different mod versions. Update to the same build.
